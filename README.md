machine learning project using python
1. Exploratory Data Analysis

2. Pre-processsing

3. Classification using k-fold cross-validation for the following classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
K- Nearest  Neighbour classifier
Suggestion: Create separate function for each classifier

4. Comparison of above mentioned classifiers w.r.t. average accuracies (across k different folds) and sum total of confusion matrices   (across k different folds)
